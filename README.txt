This toy filesystem was originally an assignment for a Computer Systems class at Northeastern University, taught by Nat Tuck. I co-authored this code with Caleb Wollfend for the assignment specifications. Then I continued to expand on the code individually. 


Co-Authors:
  Nat Tuck:
    Provided started code (empty methods, complete simple utility methods) in the following files.
    Most of these files are heavily edited from their origional form. The design is inspired by Nat Tuck's lectures from his Computer Systems course at Northeastern University in the Spring of 2017.


  Caleb Wollfend:
    Worked extensivly with me to create a basic file system. Together we added the folowing functionality:
	- Adding 4kMB files to root
	- Removing files
	- Reading files
	- Writing files
	- Reading entries in a directory


Personally added features:
These are features I authored 100% on my own.
	- Creating directories
	- Adding 4kMB files to directories other than root
